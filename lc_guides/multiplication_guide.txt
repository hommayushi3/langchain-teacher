# Two-Digit Multiplication Lesson

## Objective
To learn the step-by-step process of multiplying two two-digit numbers.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of single-digit multiplication.
- Understanding of the concept of place value (tens and ones).

## Materials
- Pencil
- Paper

## Overview
Two-digit multiplication involves multiple steps. You multiply various combinations of tens and ones, and then sum them up. The key is to keep track of the place values.

## Steps

### Step 1: Set up the Problem
Write one of the two-digit numbers on the top and the other number on the bottom, aligning them to the right.

```
  23
x 47
```

### Step 2: Multiply Ones Place of Second Number with the First Number
First, multiply the ones digit of the second number by the entire first number. Write down the product below the line.

```
  23
x 47
----
 161  (23 * 7)
```

### Step 3: Multiply Tens Place of Second Number with the First Number
Now multiply the tens digit of the second number by the entire first number. Once you have the product, add a zero to the end. Write this number on a new line below your previous answer.

```
  23
x 47
----
 161  
 920   (23 * 4, then add a zero)
```

### Step 4: Add the Products
Draw a line below the two products you've written down. Add them to find the final answer.

```
  23
x 47
----
 161
 920
----
1081
```

So, 23 multiplied by 47 equals 1081.

## Exercises

1. Multiply 45 by 23.
2. Multiply 52 by 39.
3. Multiply 67 by 14.
4. Multiply 89 by 76.
5. Multiply 32 by 54.

## Summary
Multiplying two-digit numbers may seem complicated, but breaking it down into smaller steps makes it manageable. Always remember to keep track of place values to get an accurate result.
